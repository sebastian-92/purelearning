# Aboutstatic - The clone of a much better proxy aboutproxy, but this is truley the best proccy!
(aka aboutfart its more goofy name)

Anyways its a static chrome-brower like proxy, works for any static page hosting, to add a custom bare modify the uv config. 

DEMO URL: https://aboutstatic.pages.dev/

### Uses Ultraviolet & tompHTTP, might add dynamic support idk just depends if anyone actually ever uses this.

Currently using ths bare server 'https://geoquiz.gq/bare/' since im not hosting my own for this.

Since it does not require a nodeJS server this will work for all sorts of free hosting like netlify, cloudflare pages, etc! if you get any sort of connection issues change the bare server to a different one, heres a few extras:
- https://uv.radon.games/
- https://tomp.app/
- https://uv.holyubofficial.net/bare1/
- https://uv.holyubofficial.net/bare2/
- https://uv.holyubofficial.net/bare3/
- https://uv.holyubofficial.net/bare4/

for multi-bare just do:

- bare: ['server URL 1', 'Server url 2', 'etc...'],
